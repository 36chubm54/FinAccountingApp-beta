# FinAccountingApp

Graphical application for personal financial accounting with multicurrency, categories and reports.

The current `v1.9.1` release hardens the debt-aware backup/import flow: it adds compatibility for pre-`1.9.0` SQLite schemas, formalizes `ImportedBackupData` for low-level backup parsing, and keeps `import_backup(...)` only as a deprecated compatibility wrapper.

## 🖥️ Using the application

### Main window

After running `python main.py` from the `project` directory, a window will open with control tabs and an infographic block.
The bottom of the window now includes a persistent status bar with the app version, currency-rate status, and an `Online` toggle that can be switched at runtime without restarting.
Core tabs can now be built lazily, and post-startup maintenance runs after the first window paint to reduce startup blocking.

Tabs and actions:

- `Infographics` — displays infographics (pie charts, histograms) with the ability to filter by month/year.
- `Operations` — management of records and transfers (adding, editing, deleting, importing/exporting).
- `Reports` — report generation, export.
- `Analytics` — financial analytics for an arbitrary period (dashboard, categories, monthly report).
- `Budget` — category budgets with arbitrary date ranges, pace tracking, and live progress.
- `Debts` — debt and loan tracking: create, repay, write off, close, review history, and view progress.
- `Distribution` — monthly net-income distribution structure with fixed rows and snapshot history.
- `Settings` — management of mandatory expenses and wallets.

Infographics:

- Pie chart of expenses by category with month filter.
- Histogram of income/expenses by day of the month.
- Histogram of income/expenses by month of the year.

Income is displayed in green, expenses in red. For a pie chart, small categories are aggregated into "Other". The list of categories in the legend scrolls. Records with the "Transfer" category have been excluded to improve analysis accuracy and consistency.

### Analytics tab

Financial analytics for an arbitrary period.

- **Dashboard** — key metrics: net worth, savings rate, burn rate, avg monthly income, avg monthly expenses, year income, year expense, and cost per day/hour/minute.
- **Net Worth Timeline** — line chart of net worth by month.
- **Category Breakdown** — expenses and income by category (tables + expenses pie chart).
- **Monthly Report** — table with income, expenses, cashflow and savings rate by month.

The period filter uses `YYYY-MM-DD` in the `From` / `To` fields. Transfers are excluded from calculations.
For the `Dashboard`, net worth is now evaluated at the selected `To` date instead of using the current balance at tab-open time.
The Dashboard now includes an `ⓘ` tooltip that explains the metric formulas.
`Year expense` is calculated as calendar-year expenses up to the selected end date, and `Cost per day/hour/minute` now derives from that year-to-date expense instead of an annualized burn rate.

> **Note:** After launching the application, mandatory payments are automatically applied with a detailed GUI message displayed.
> If online mode was saved previously, the application restores it on startup and refreshes currency rates in the background.

### Budget tab

Planning and tracking category budgets across arbitrary date ranges.

- `New Budget` form: `Category`, `From`, `To`, `Limit (KZT)`, and `Include mandatory expenses`.
- Budget Treeview columns: `Category`, `Period`, `Limit`, `Spent`, `Remaining`, `Usage %`, `Pace`, `Status`, `Include mandatory`.
- Pace states: `on_track`, `overpace`, `overspent`.
- Period states: `future`, `active`, `expired`.
- The progress canvas is displayed below the table:
  colored bar = share of budget spent, blue vertical = share of time elapsed.
- Multiple budgets per category are allowed as long as their date ranges do not overlap.

### Distribution tab

Monthly net-income allocation structure and month-by-month history view.

- The left `Distribution Structure` panel manages top-level items/subitems with percentages and optional groups.
- The right `Distribution Table` shows `Month`, `Fixed`, `Net income`, and calculated item/subitem allocation columns.
- `Fix Row` freezes or unfreezes a month row; auto-fixed closed months are protected from manual unfix.
- When frozen rows are requested, the service auto-freezes closed past months.
- Validation requires top-level items to total `100%`, and subitems within an item to total `100%` when present.

### Debts tab

Tracks liabilities (`Debt`) and issued loans (`Loan`) with dedicated history and payoff progress.

- `New Debt / Loan` form: `Kind`, `Contact`, `Amount`, `Date`, `Wallet`, `Description`.
- The table shows `Contact`, `Kind`, `Total`, `Remaining`, `Status`, `Created`.
- Actions for the selected debt: `Pay`, `Write off`, `Close`, `Delete`, `Refresh`.
- `Write off` reduces the remaining balance without changing wallet balance.
- `Delete` removes the debt card and debt-payment history, but does not roll back linked income/expense records or historical wallet balances.
- The progress bar and `History` block show paid, written-off, and remaining portions of the debt.

### Adding income/expense

1. Open the `Operations` tab.
2. In the `Add operation` block, select the type of operation (`Income` or `Expense`).
3. Enter the date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` (the date cannot be in the future).
4. Enter the amount.
5. Specify the currency (default is `KZT`).
6. Specify a category (default is `General`).
   The category field is an editable `Combobox`: for `Income` it suggests known income categories, for `Expense` it suggests expense categories; manual input is still allowed.
7. Optionally fill in `Description`.
8. Click `Save`.

The amount is converted into the base currency `KZT` at the current rates of the currency service. Once an entry is added, the list is automatically updated.

### Adding a transfer

1. Open the `Operations` tab.
2. In the `Transfer` block, select `From wallet` and `To wallet`.
3. Enter the date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` (the date cannot be in the future and cannot be earlier than UNIX time).
4. Enter the amount.
5. Specify the currency (default is `KZT`).
6. Optionally enter `Commission` and its currency.
7. Optionally fill in `Description`.
8. Click `Save`.

### Deleting an entry

1. Open the `Operations` tab.
2. Select an entry from the list.
3. Click `Delete Selected`. A deletion message appears with the index of the entry or ID of the transfer.

### Delete all entries

1. Open the `Operations` tab.
2. In the `List of operations` block, select an entry from the list.
3. Click `Delete All Records` and confirm the deletion. The entries will be permanently deleted and the list of entries will be updated.

### Inline record editing

1. Open the `Operations` tab.
2. Select a record in the list.
3. Click `Edit`.
4. Change `Date`, `Wallet`, `Amount KZT`, `Category`, and optionally `Description`.
5. Click `Save`.

The update is applied through the immutable domain model: a new record instance is created, `rate_at_operation` is recalculated automatically, and `description` remains optional. The date is validated (`YYYY-MM-DD`, not in the future and not earlier than UNIX time) and the wallet must be active. Transfer-linked records and records with category `"Transfer"` cannot be edited.

### Report generation

1. Open the `Reports` tab.
2. Enter filters (optional):
    - `Period` — period start (`YYYY`, `YYYY-MM`, `YYYY-MM-DD`).
    - `Period end` — period end (`YYYY`, `YYYY-MM`, `YYYY-MM-DD`).
    - `Category` — filter by category.
3. Choose one wallet for generating the report on it or all wallets.
4. Optionally enable `Group by category` — grouped view (double-click a category to open its details; use `Back` to return to the summary).
5. Choose `Totals mode`:
    - `On fixed rate` — totals based on fixed `amount_kzt` (operation-time rate).
    - `On current rate` — totals on current FX rates (`CurrencyService`).
6. Click `Generate`.

On the right, the “Monthly summary” block shows month-level income/expense aggregates.

Export report:

- Formats: `CSV`, `XLSX`, `PDF`.
- Report title includes the selected range:
  `Transaction statement (<start_date> - <end_date>)`.
- If `Period end` is not provided, current date is used as the period end.
- In addition to the main records, a `Yearly Report` sheet with a monthly summary is added to `XLSX`. The `By Category` sheet is created only when grouping adds a distinct summary rather than duplicating an already filtered report.
- `XLSX` now ships as a more readable export: styled header/total rows, `freeze panes`, `auto filter`, auto-sized columns, and numeric amount cells instead of stringified totals.
- In `PDF` the monthly summary remains, and after the main statement, category tables are added; if the report is already filtered to a single category, the duplicate grouped section is skipped.
- When `Group by category` is enabled, exporting the summary view uses grouped report export in `CSV` / `XLSX` / `PDF`.

### Opening Balance in Filtered Reports

- `Initial balance` is the starting balance of the whole history and does not depend on filters.
- `Opening balance` is the balance at the beginning of the selected period and is calculated dynamically.
- For `YYYY`, period start is `YYYY-01-01`.
- For `YYYY-MM`, period start is `YYYY-MM-01`.
- For `YYYY-MM-DD`, period start is the provided date.
- The period filter cannot point to a future date (for all supported formats).

### Managing mandatory expenses

In the `Settings` tab, in the `Mandatory Expenses` block, the following operations are available:

- `Add` — add a mandatory expense.
- `Edit` — inline edit the selected template.
- `Delete` — delete the selected one.
- `Delete All` — delete everything.
- `Add to Records` — add the selected expense to records with the specified date.
- File format selector for import/export.
- `Import` — import of mandatory expenses.
- `Export` — export of mandatory expenses.

Mandatory expense fields:

- `Wallet`, `Amount`, `Currency`, `Category` (default `Mandatory`), `Description` (required), `Period` (`daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `yearly`).

#### Mandatory expense template fields

- `Date` (optional, `YYYY-MM-DD`) — if provided, the `auto_pay` flag is set automatically
- `auto_pay` — derived from `date`: non-empty → `True`, empty → `False`

`auto_pay` behavior:

- Applies to all templates with a non-empty `date` (i.e. `auto_pay=True`).
- Auto-pay does not start before the template `date` (anchor date).
- Frequency is defined by `period`:
  `daily` — 1 record per day;
  `weekly` — 1 record per week on the same weekday as `date`;
  `monthly` — 1 record per month with the same `DD` (clamped to month end);
  `yearly` — 1 record per year with the same `MM-DD` (clamped for missing days, e.g. Feb 29).

#### Inline template editing

1. Select a template in the list.
2. Click `Edit`.
3. Change `Amount KZT`, `Date`, `Period` and/or `Wallet`.
4. Click `Save`.

`amount_kzt` is validated numerically; `date` is validated against the `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
`auto_pay` is recalculated automatically when the date changes.

Import/export of mandatory expenses:

- Import: `CSV`, `XLSX`.
- Export: `CSV`, `XLSX`.
- Runtime templates in SQLite can now store `date` and derived `auto_pay`.
- The `date` field for `mandatory_expenses` is now preserved in `CSV`/`XLSX` import-export.

### Finance Audit

In the `Settings` tab, the `Finance Audit` block provides a `Run Audit` button.

Clicking it runs a read-only diagnostic of the SQLite database.
The audit checks:

- System wallet sanity (`id=1` exists and has `system=1`)
- Transfer pair integrity (exactly 2 linked records: income + expense per transfer)
- Alignment of `transfers` aggregates with linked `expense`/`income` records
- Transfer-linked record invariants (consistency of wallet IDs, amounts, currency, and categories)
- Amount consistency (amount_kzt equals amount_original × rate_at_operation)
- Positivity of amount_original and amount_kzt in records / transfers / mandatory_expenses
- Rate positivity (rate_at_operation > 0 for all records)
- Date validity (YYYY-MM-DD format, not in the future)
- Currency code presence (currency not empty)
- Mandatory template date/auto_pay consistency (`auto_pay` matches whether `date` is provided)

Results are shown in a modal dialog grouped into three sections:
`Errors`, `Warnings`, `Passed`. The database is never modified.

### Balance Engine

`BalanceService` is a read-only analytical service that derives financial state from the record history.
Balance is never stored in the database — it is always computed dynamically.

Available methods:

- `get_wallet_balance(wallet_id, date=None)` — wallet balance (optionally at a given date)
- `get_wallet_balances(date=None)` — balances of all active wallets
- `get_total_balance(date=None)` — total system net worth including open debts/loans
- `get_cashflow(start_date, end_date)` — income, expenses, and net cashflow for a period
- `get_income(start_date, end_date)` — income for a period
- `get_expenses(start_date, end_date)` — expenses for a period

The service is strictly read-only and never modifies the database.
Transfer records (`category='Transfer'`) are excluded from cashflow calculations to prevent double-counting.

### Timeline Engine

Analytical service that builds historical financial dynamics.

| Method                                       | Description                                    |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `get_net_worth_timeline()`                   | Net worth (KZT) at the end of each month       |
| `get_monthly_cashflow(start_date, end_date)` | Monthly income, expenses, and cashflow         |
| `get_cumulative_income_expense()`            | Running totals of income and expenses by month |

All methods are read-only. Transfers (`transfer_id IS NOT NULL`) are excluded from cashflow calculations
to prevent double-counting; they are included in net worth (expense + income = 0, neutral).
Initial balances (`wallets.initial_balance`) are included in every timeline point.

### Metrics Engine

Analytical service for calculating financial metrics on the fly.

| Method                                          | Description                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `get_savings_rate(start, end)`                  | Savings rate (%) for a custom period          |
| `get_burn_rate(start, end)`                     | Average daily expense (KZT)                   |
| `get_spending_by_category(start, end)`          | Expenses by category, sorted descending       |
| `get_income_by_category(start, end)`            | Income by category, sorted descending         |
| `get_top_expense_categories(start, end, top_n)` | Top N expense categories                      |
| `get_monthly_summary(start, end)`               | Monthly income/expenses/cashflow/savings rate |

All methods are read-only. Transfers are excluded from all calculations (`transfer_id IS NULL`).
Metrics are computed via SQL aggregates with no intermediate storage.

### Importing financial records

Import is performed via `Import` in the `Operations` tab.

Import architecture:

- `ImportService -> FinancialController (FinanceService) -> RecordRepository/Storage`.
- Import does not create records directly through `JsonStorage/SQLiteStorage`.
- Transfers are created only via `create_transfer(...)` (the `1 transfer = 2 record` invariant is preserved).
- Before any write, the application performs a dry-run: full parse and validation without touching SQLite.
- In the `Operations` tab, the dry-run result is shown in a modal preview dialog; the user either confirms or cancels the real import.
- The real import runs inside the service transaction and returns a structured `ImportResult`.
- `Full Backup` preserves source `amount_kzt` and `rate_at_operation` values.
- `Current Rate` recalculates values using `CurrencyService.get_rate(...)`.
- Parser-level guardrails are enabled (file size, row limit, CSV field size).
- Invalid rows are not written to the database and are returned in `ImportResult.errors`; valid rows may still be imported.
- If the dry-run finds no valid rows (`imported == 0`), the preview dialog does not allow the user to continue.
- `initial_balance` is allowed only once per import file. Duplicate rows are reported in the preview/result.
- `wallet_id` in import data must be a positive integer (no fractional part).
- Non-numeric and non-finite values (`NaN`, `inf`) in numeric import fields are rejected.

Formats:

- Through the `Operations` tab UI: `CSV`, `XLSX`.
- At the controller/service level, `JSON` is also supported.
- Import pipeline: `parser -> dry-run validation -> user confirmation -> SQLite transaction`.
- For `CSV/XLSX`, the real import replaces runtime data with valid rows from the file; invalid rows remain only in the import report.
- For readonly `JSON` snapshots, `force=True` is required; readonly/checksum validation happens before the commit stage.
- `JSON` full backup can now include `budgets`, `debts`, `debt_payments`, `distribution_items`, `distribution_subitems`, and `distribution_snapshots`; on import they are restored into SQLite when the corresponding subsystems are supported.
- For `JSON` full backup, distribution structure is validated strictly: malformed item/subitem payloads now fail the import instead of being skipped silently.

Data format:

- **CSV/XLSX data (import/export):**  
  `date,type,wallet_id,category,amount_original,currency,rate_at_operation,amount_kzt,description,period,transfer_id,from_wallet_id,to_wallet_id`.
- `wallet_id` — identifier of the wallet in which the operation was made.
- `transfer_id` — identifier of the transfer between wallets.
- `from_wallet_id` — identifier of the source wallet in a transfer.
- `to_wallet_id` — identifier of the target wallet in a transfer.
- Legacy import is supported (old files with the `amount` field or the `Amount (KZT)` column).
- All existing entries are replaced with data from the file.

Important:

- `CSV/XLSX report` and `CSV/XLSX data` are different formats.
- Report `CSV/XLSX` is read-only by the user and **should not** be used as a data source for import.

### ImportPolicy

There are 3 modes available for importing records:

- `Full Backup` (`ImportPolicy.FULL_BACKUP`)  
  Used for full import with a fixed transaction rate. Expected string format:
  `date,type,wallet_id,category,amount_original,currency,rate_at_operation,amount_kzt,description,period,transfer_id,from_wallet_id,to_wallet_id`.
- `Current Rate` (`ImportPolicy.CURRENT_RATE`)  
  For each imported line, the rate is taken at the time of import through `CurrencyService.get_rate(currency)`, and `rate_at_operation` and `amount_kzt` are recalculated and fixed again.
- `Legacy Import` (`ImportPolicy.LEGACY`)
  The old `date,type,category,amount` format is automatically migrated to the new one:
  `currency="KZT"`, `rate_at_operation=1.0`, `amount_kzt=amount`.

All modes perform line-by-line validation and return `ImportResult`
(`imported`, `skipped`, `errors`, `dry_run`).

### Dry-run Mode

- Before writing to the database, the application performs a full dry-run: the file is parsed and validated without modifying any records.
- A preview dialog shows the number of records to import, skipped rows, and any errors.
- The user explicitly confirms or cancels before data is changed.

### Backup

Full backup is implemented in `JSON` format in two modes:

- `Snapshot backup` (default):
  - root object: `meta` + `data`;
  - `meta.readonly=true`, `meta.checksum` (SHA256 of `data`);
  - checksum is computed deterministically via `json.dumps(data, sort_keys=True, ensure_ascii=False, separators=(",", ":"))`.
- `Technical backup` (`readonly=False`):
  - legacy-compatible JSON without `meta` and checksum;
  - used by the standard import pipeline without readonly protection.
- Snapshot metadata:
  - `meta.app_version` is taken from `version.py`;
  - `meta.storage` is provided by the caller and is no longer hardcoded to `sqlite`.
  - GUI full-backup export from `Settings` marks the source as `meta.storage="sqlite"`.
- The `Settings` tab contains the following buttons:
  - `Export Full Backup`
  - `Import Full Backup`
- Importing a readonly snapshot requires `force=True` (or force confirmation in UI).

Backup restores:

- wallets with fields `id/name/currency/balance`;
- all records with fields `type/date/wallet_id/transfer_id/category/amount_original/currency/rate_at_operation/amount_kzt/category/description`;
- all mandatory expenses with `date/description/period`;
- distribution structure: `distribution_items` and `distribution_subitems`;
- frozen `distribution_snapshots` with visible column layout and values;
- all transfers between wallets.

Additionally:

- JSON export now writes atomically via a temporary file + `os.replace`, preventing partially written backup files;
- startup SQLite → JSON export uses already frozen distribution months and can skip auto-freeze inside the background export thread.

### FX Revaluation

`Report` supports:

- `net_worth_fixed()` — net asset value at the time of recording;
- `net_worth_current()` — net asset value at the current rate;
- `total_fixed()` — accounting total at the exchange rate on the transaction date;
- `total_current(currency_service)` — total at the current rate;
- `fx_difference(currency_service)` — revaluation (`current - fixed`);
- `total()` — alias for `total_fixed()` (backward compatibility).

### Migration

Rules for migrating old formats:

- legacy `amount` -> `amount_original`;
- missing currency -> `KZT`;
- missing course -> `1.0`;
- missing `amount_kzt` -> calculated according to the import policy;
- invalid lines are skipped and included in the error list.

### Data storage

SQLite (`finance.db`) is the only runtime storage.
JSON (`data.json`) is no longer used as an application backend and remains only for:

- JSON import;
- JSON export;
- backups.

During startup, after SQLite integrity validation, the current runtime state is exported to `data.json`.
This export now preserves `mandatory_expenses.date`, `budgets`, the Distribution System structure, and frozen `distribution_snapshots`.

A dedicated `storage/` layer is used for data access:

- `storage/base.py` — `Storage` contract (data-access operations only).
- `storage/json_storage.py` — JSON adapter for import/export/backup only.
- `storage/sqlite_storage.py` — `SQLiteStorage` based on standard `sqlite3`.
- `db/schema.sql` — SQL schema for `wallets`, `records`, `transfers`, `mandatory_expenses`, `budgets`, `debts`, `debt_payments`, and `distribution_*`.
- For pre-`1.9.0` SQLite databases, bootstrap first adds `records.related_debt_id` and only then applies the full schema with debt indexes.

### JSON -> SQLite migration

Use `migrate_json_to_sqlite.py` for safe data migration.

Run examples:

```bash
# Validation only, no write
python migrate_json_to_sqlite.py --dry-run

# Full migration
python migrate_json_to_sqlite.py --json-path data.json --sqlite-path finance.db
```

What the script does:

- loads source data via `JsonStorage`;
- writes to SQLite in one explicit transaction with strict order:
  `wallets -> transfers -> debts -> records -> mandatory_expenses -> budgets -> debt_payments -> distribution_items -> distribution_subitems -> distribution_snapshots`;
- preserves existing `id` values (or builds `old_id -> new_id` mapping when ids are auto-generated);
- populates precision fields `*_minor` and `rate_at_operation_text` while writing;
- for full backup, strictly validates `distribution_items` / `distribution_subitems` and aborts migration on malformed payloads;
- validates integrity and compares balances/`net worth`;
- performs `rollback` on any error or mismatch.
- is safe to rerun: if SQLite already has an equivalent dataset, migration is skipped without failure.

### Runtime storage configuration

`config.py` defines the paths:

- `SQLITE_PATH = "finance.db"`
- `JSON_PATH = "data.json"`
- `JSON_BACKUP_KEEP_LAST = 30` — how many timestamped JSON backups to keep in `project/backups/` (older ones are pruned on startup after creating a new backup).
- `LAZY_EXPORT_SIZE_THRESHOLD = 50 * 1024 * 1024` — SQLite size threshold (in bytes) above which SQLite → JSON export may run in the background.

Paths are resolved relative to the `project` directory, so `finance.db` and `data.json` are created inside `project` even when launched from another folder.

Initialization is handled by `bootstrap.py`:

- the application always uses SQLite as runtime storage;
- if `finance.db` is missing, the database and schema are created on startup;
- the bootstrap ensures that a system wallet exists;
- SQLite internal integrity is validated on startup:
  `PRAGMA foreign_key_check`, transfer linkage (`exactly 2 linked records: income+expense`),
  no orphan records, and no CHECK-like violations;
- after a successful integrity check, a lazy SQLite → `data.json` export is performed:
  export runs only if `data.json` is missing or older than `finance.db`;
  for large databases, export may run in a background thread (non-blocking UI);
- post-startup maintenance can run separately from `bootstrap_repository()` so the GUI can show the window first and then perform freeze/export/backup synchronization;
- JSON bootstrap and direct runtime work against `data.json` have been removed.

SQLite behavior by identifiers:

- For work operations, `INSERT` is performed without manual transmission of `id`; `id` is generated by SQLite.
- For scenarios of complete data replacement (`replace_all_data`, backup import, normalization after import), entities are reindexed into the range `1..N`.
- With this reindexing, links (`wallet_id`, `transfer_id`, `from_wallet_id`, `to_wallet_id`) are remapped atomically to maintain the integrity of the links.
- After clearing tables, `sqlite_sequence` is reset so that new records start at `1` again.
- Data equality checks before/after import should be performed on business fields and invariants, not on specific `id` values.

SQLite behavior for money fields:

- Monetary values are stored in both `REAL` columns and exact integer minor-units (`*_minor`).
- FX rates additionally store canonical text in `rate_at_operation_text`.
- `SQLiteStorage` auto-adds and backfills these precision columns for existing databases.

## 🏗️ Project architecture

The project follows a layered architecture:

- `domain/` — business models and rules (records, budgets, debts/loans, reports, data audit, date/period validation, currencies, wallets, transfers).
- `app/` — use cases, including audit execution, and the currency service adapter.
- `infrastructure/` — JSON and SQLite `RecordRepository` implementations, including debt/debt-payment persistence.
- `storage/` — storage abstraction and JSON/SQLite adapters.
- `db/` — SQLite SQL schema.
- `bootstrap.py` — SQLite initialization and startup validation.
- `backup.py` — JSON backup and SQLite -> JSON export, including `budgets`, `debts`, `debt_payments`, and distribution payloads.
- `config.py` — runtime SQLite and JSON import/export paths.
- `services/` — service layer for import orchestration, read-only SQLite audit, budgets, debts/loans, and analytics.
- `utils/` — import/export and preparation of data for graphs.
- `gui/` — GUI layer (Tkinter).

Data flow for GUI:

- UI (Tkinter) → `gui/controllers.py` → `app/use_cases.py` → `infrastructure/sqlite_repository.py` → `finance.db`.

Domain relationships:

- `Record` belongs to `Wallet` through `record.wallet_id`.
- `Transfer` links two records (`expense`/`income`) through `transfer_id`.
- Transfer commission is stored as a separate `Expense` (`Commission` category) and is not part of the linked transfer record pair.

### Immutable Domain Model

- `Record` is immutable (`@dataclass(frozen=True)`), including the `id` field.
- Any record update creates a new object instead of mutating the existing one.
- Amount edits use `with_updated_amount_kzt(new_amount_kzt)`.
- This protects financial data integrity and prepares the architecture for SQLite migration.

## 🧪 Tests

### Launch

```bash
# Go to project directory
cd "FU Project/project"

# Install dev dependencies (if not installed yet)
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run all tests (inside activated venv)
python -m pytest

# With verbose output
python -m pytest -v

# Specific file
python -m pytest tests/test_records.py -v

# Specific test
python -m pytest tests/test_reports.py::test_report_total -v
```

### Coverage

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing
python -m pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html
```

> **Note:** The tests expect the `CurrencyService` to use local courses by default (parameter `use_online=False`).

## 💱 Supported currencies

Default application rates:

| Currency          | Code | Default rate | Description     |
| ----------------- | ---- | ------------ | --------------- |
| Kazakhstani tenge | KZT  | 1.0          | Base currency   |
| US dollar         | USD  | 500.0        | 1 USD = 500 KZT |
| Euro              | EUR  | 590.0        | 1 EUR = 590 KZT |
| Russian ruble     | RUB  | 6.5          | 1 RUB = 6.5 KZT |

By default, the application uses local exchange rates. Online mode can be enabled either at construction time with `CurrencyService(use_online=True)` or later via `CurrencyService.set_online(True)` or the `Online` toggle in the bottom status bar. After a successful fetch, National Bank of Kazakhstan rates are saved to `currency_rates.json`, and the status bar shows the latest update time.
